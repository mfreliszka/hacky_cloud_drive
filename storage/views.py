# View Details:
# RegisterView: A generic CreateAPIView that uses the RegisterSerializer to create a new user. We set permission_classes = [AllowAny] so that new users can register without being authenticated. The create method is overridden to return a custom response (just the new user's info). (By default, it would return the serialized user including the write-only password field which we don't want). We could also integrate token creation here, but we'll keep it simple.
# Login: We will use the JWT login view provided by DRF SimpleJWT instead of writing our own. Specifically, TokenObtainPairView provides an endpoint to get an access and refresh token pair by username and password.
# UserDashboardView: A ListAPIView that returns the current user's folders (with nested files as defined in the serializer). We enforce IsAuthenticated, so only logged-in users can access. The get_queryset filters Folder objects by owner=self.request.user to ensure each user only sees their own folders and files. This is critical for security: users should not even retrieve objects that aren't theirs. By filtering at the queryset level, we ensure no other user's data is included.If we had detail views or allowed editing/deleting of folders/files, we would implement object-level permission checks (e.g., a custom permission ensuring obj.owner == request.user) to prevent accessing others' objectsâ€‹
# . In this simple dashboard list, filtering the query by user is sufficient to enforce this restriction.
